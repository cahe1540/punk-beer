### Description

This project is a search UI for the Punk Beer API using React. This project implements React Hooks, and React Router. I made this project to practice working in React. The
app fetches a default search querie to the Punk Beer API and displays the result as cards to the user. The user can enter a search query in a search bar and request their own results from the API. The user can select their favorites from the display and the app will store a favorites list and display them in a separate page. If the user leaves the website and returns, the website can remember what the user favored using local storage.
